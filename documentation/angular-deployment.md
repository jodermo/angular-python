# Angular Deployment (frontend)

To run Angular in serve mode, follow these steps:

1. Change into the project directory:
    ```bash
   cd angular-python/
    ```

2. Start The Frontend:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
   This will launch the angular app in build mode at: [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) and in serve mode at: [localhost:4300](http://localhost:4300)



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
