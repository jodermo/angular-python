# Directory for SSL certificate

This directory is specifically dedicated to storing SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate files. SSL certificates are essential for establishing secure encrypted connections between clients and the server.

#### The directory contains the following required files for SSL certificate configuration:

- `/certificate.pem` <br> This file holds the SSL certificate, which is a digital document issued by a trusted certification authority (CA). It contains information about the server's identity and is used to verify the server's authenticity.
- `/private_key.pem` <br> This file contains the private key associated with the SSL certificate. The private key is a secret cryptographic key used for decrypting encrypted data received by the server.
