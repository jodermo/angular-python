## Server Resources

The `resources` folder is used to store files that are generated during runtime. These files are created by the application and are essential for its proper functioning. The exact contents of this folder may vary depending on the specific usage and runtime behavior.

### Accessing Runtime-Generated Files

To access the runtime-generated files, follow these steps:

1. Run the application.
2. Perform the necessary actions or trigger the specific functionality that generates the files.
3. Once the files are generated, they will be saved in the `resources` folder.
4. Use the generated files as required by the application.

Please note that the specific details and behavior of the runtime-generated files will depend on the application's logic and implementation.

## Uploaded Files
- [/uploads](./uploads)

The 'upload' folder is intended for storing files that have been uploaded through the application. These files could be user-generated content, attachments, or any other type of files uploaded by users.


## PostgreSQL Data Storage
- [/postgres-data](./postgres-data)

The 'postgres-data' folder is used to store the data files for PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database management system. This folder is essential for preserving the data integrity and persistence of your PostgreSQL database.


## Angular Build Output (dist)
- [/dist](./dist)

The 'dist' folder contains the output of the Angular build process. It contains the compiled HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and other frontend files that make up your Angular application.
